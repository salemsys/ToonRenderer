# ToonRenderer

ToonRenderer is a Panda3D Tool for creating and taking screenshots of characters from Toontown Online/Rewritten

# Getting Started

Before running the tool, you have to unpack the Toontown Rewritten phase files and place them into a `resources` folder in the root of the project. You can find a guide of how to unpack Rewritten's resources [here.](https://toontownrewritten.wiki/Phase_files)

Once you've added the resources into the project root, you can open the ToonRenderer tool by running `runRenderer.bat` on the project's root folder.
